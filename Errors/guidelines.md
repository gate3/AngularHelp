# Guidelines for contributing to Errors

The Error folders contain a list of errors that you have encountered and would like to tell everyone about or common errors that you know and want to talk about a solution for it.

## Rules

1. Create a new directory for each new post. If you only have a markdown file (.md) in the directory, it should be named main.md.

2. The directory name should be a very short summary of what the error is. Find a way to shorten it. e.g. If you want to write about the expression changed after view Init was checked error, you can use something like. Expression changed After Init.

3. Be as brief and clear as possible in your explanation

4. If you wish to provide sample code, add the necessary .ts, .html files etc. to your solution's directory. Also provide a .md file explaining what was done.
