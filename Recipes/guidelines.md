# Guidelines for contributing to Recipes

The Recipes folders contain a simple tutorials on how to create specific functionality using Angular.

## Rules

1. Create a new directory for each new recipe. If you only have a markdown file (.md) in the directory, it should be named main.md.

2. The directory name should be a very short summary of what the Tip is. Find a way to shorten it. 

3. Be as brief and clear as possible in your explanation

4. If you wish to provide sample code, add the necessary .ts, .html files etc. to your solution's directory. Also provide a .md file explaining what was done.
