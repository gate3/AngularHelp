# Guidelines for contributing to Tips

The Tips directory contain a list of How-To's. It could be something like how to optimize your Angular Code etc.

## Rules

1. Create a new directory for each new tip. If you only have a markdown file (.md) in the directory, it should be named main.md.

2. The directory name should be a very short summary of what the Tip is. Find a way to shorten it. 

3. Be as brief and clear as possible in your explanation

4. If you wish to provide sample code, add the necessary .ts, .html files etc. to your solution's directory. Also provide a .md file explaining what was done.
